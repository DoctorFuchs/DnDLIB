# DnDLIB

DnDLIB is a simple webapp to read, search rules of dungeons and dragons comfortful. 

With using W3.CSS our design is simple and minimalistic.

## Install

Requirements: Python3, pip (often included to python3)

```bash
git clone $this repo // or download it as zip if you have no git installed
// unpack and go to the directory
// if you want you can create a virtual env here
python3 -m pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Starting the server

Because we are using an api to get the data, you must be online to use this web app.

```bash
python3 -m server
```

## Contributing

Because this is a school project I can't accept PRs. But in around 3/4 months this will be a "free" project. (You can still open issues)
